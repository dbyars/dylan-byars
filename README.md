The second version of dylanbyars.com

Todo: 

1. Add a little link to the project-preview elements so you can go look at the code for each project directly
2. Adjust the media queries for the weather app and periodic table app so they look better.
3. Write up the "about the site" bit
4. Add links to the bottom of each page (above the footer) for links to the other pages in the site so users don't have to scroll back to the top to continue exploring.
5. Figure out how to get the 404 page to display and write something pithy. 
6. Setup react-helmet
7. maybe setup react-snapshot
8. Get rid of all the typography stuff I'm not actually using.
9. remove the console.logs from the nav element
10. lay and hide easter eggs
