The second version of dylanbyars.com

Todo: 

1. Add a little link to the project-preview windows so you can go look at the code for them directly
2. Adjust the media queries for the weather app and periodic table app so they look better.
3. Write up the "about the site" bit
4. Add links to the bottom of each page (above the footer) for links to the other pages in the site so users don't have to scroll back to the top to continue exploring.
5. Figure out how to get the 404 page to display and write something pithy.
